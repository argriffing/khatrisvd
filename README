The khatrisvd package will probably depend on python 2.6 features.


To check the speed of singular value decomposition on MATLAB vs.
whatever linear algebra library Numpy is connected to,
use these programs:
svdtimer.py
svdtimer.m

Usage:
python svdtimer.py 450 10000
matlab -nojvm -nodisplay -nodesktop -nosplash -r svdtimer


Each module will run a self-test when run from the command line.
Use the python coverage program to check the coverage of the tests.
coverage -x <module.py>
coverage -r <module.py>
